**Setup Instructions for Windows/XAMPP:**


1. Copy `minimedia.rar` to `C:/xampp/htdocs/minimedia`. or what ever you want to call it.
2. Import `database/media.sql` into MySQL using phpMyAdmin.
3. Edit `config.php`:

- Set `$tmdb_api` with your TMDb API key (Free signup).
Drop in media to correct folder then step 4 or upload from admin.
4. Run `scan.php` once via browser to populate the database.
5. Open `http://localhost/minimedia/index.php` in your browser.
6. Click Play on any movie/TV show or Music to stream via `stream.php`.

Admin user and pass is just admin/admin

This works for me in Firefox, IE and in Chrome.
Should work on smart tv devices xbox.
Other than that you on your own. Have fun!
